# PROJECT GOAL

 **This project is designed as an TCP based list making Application for tracking and managing daily tasks or project lifecycle using
Python, Flask, ORM, MySQL, Docker by following highly scalable Model View Controller Pattern.** 

 <br>
 
 **For each and every user login session has been created with same account for tracking tasks all the operations including adding card, 
modifying card, moving card, deleting card and archiving cards has been implemented using Object relational Mapping technique**

<br>

**For network-based operations streams has been used which is high level async/await ready primitives helps to run TCP server in 
asynchronous manner**

# Project Motivation

**His idea is straightforward. Rather than relying on Post-its or productivity apps, use your digital calendar to organize your time. For every task you have to get done, estimate how long it will take, and block that period off in advance**

# Requirements Installation

If you are using a lower version of Python you can upgrade using the pip package, ensuring you have the latest version of pip. To install the required packages and libraries, run this command in the project directory after cloning the repository**
